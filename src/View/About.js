          <p>Music is a part of all of our lives, from when we're growing up to
          when we're old. Music is one of the most calming and soothing things 
          if you let it be. It comes from melodies and tunes
          strung together by people who sing and play musical instruments. The
          power of music shows in the simplest of things, such as when you
          absentmindedly tap your foot to a beat or hum a tune unknowingly.
